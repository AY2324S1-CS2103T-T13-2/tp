3. Troubleshooting / FAQ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `CampusConnect.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar CampusConnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to CampusConnect.

   * `add n/Jane Doe p/98765433 e/janed@example.com a/Jane street, block 123, #01-01 t/floorball t/suitemate` : Adds a contact named `Jane Doe` to CampusConnect who is tagged with the `floorball` and `suitemate` tags.

   * `optout notify birthdays` : Opts out from birthday notifications.

   * `addemer 3 RA` : Marks the 3rd contact in the list as an RA (Residential Assistant).

   * `find name/Doe` : Finds all contacts who have "Doe" in their name.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional, ___with `addalt` as an exception. (Refer to [addalt](#addalt) under Features)___<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `updatephoto 2 path/C:/photos/new_betsycrowe.png`
  * Updates the photo for the 2nd person with a new image from the specified path.


###  Find contacts

Lists contacts whose fields match the specified the specified find expression.

Format: `find FIND_EXPRESSION`

Find expressions have a low barrier to entry that allows for simple filtering by field. This basic filtering for contacts is likely sufficient for most of your use cases. We recommend that you first read the [basic filtering](#find-contacts-basic-filtering) section to learn how to perform simple filtering by a single field.

If you then find that the basic filtering is insufficient for your use case, you can read the [advanced filtering](#find-contacts-advanced-filtering) section to learn how to perform more complex filtering.



<panel header="**Supported Fields**" type="primary" id="find-fields-table" expanded no-close>
Across both basic and advanced filtering, the following fields are supported:<br><br>

| Field | Prefix | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Name  | `n`   | Finds contacts whose names **contain** the given keyword. |
| Phone | `p`   | Finds contacts whose phone numbers **contain** the given digits. |
| Email | `e`   | Finds contacts whose email addresses **contain** the given keyword. |
| Address | `a` | Finds contacts whose addresses **contain** the given keyword. |
| Tag   | `t`   | Finds contacts who have any tag that **exactly matches** the given keyword. |

</panel>

<br>

<box type="info">

Note that in all cases, the search is case-insensitive for alphabetic characters. For example, `n/Joe` will match contacts who have the name `Joe`, `joE`, `Ajoeia`, `BobJOe Lee`, etc., and `t/friend` will match `friend`, `FriENd`, `FRIEND`, etc.
</box>


<box type="warning">

For now, search keywords cannot contain spaces. For example, `n/John Doe` will not work as expected. Functionality to search for keywords which spaces like `"John Doe"` will be added in a future release.
</box>

#### Find contacts: basic filtering

Contacts can be filtered by a single field by typing:
- the **prefix** of the field you're searching through, followed by
- a **slash** (`/`), followed by
- the **keyword** you're looking for.

Such a search will return all contacts whose field matches the keyword based on the behavior specified in the [supported fields table](#find-fields-table).

We call this basic block of filtering a **find condition**, which is the smallest unit that act as a valid [**`FIND_EXPRESSION`**](#find-contacts).


<box>

For example, given the following contacts (some fields omitted for brevity):

| Name | Tags |
| ---- | ---- |
| John Doe | neighbor, colleague |
| Jane Doe | neighbor, friend |
| Alex Yeoh | friend |
| Yervis Alexis | girlfriend |


`n/do` is a **find condition** that will return all contacts whose names contain the substring `"do"`, in this case `"John Doe"` and `"Jane Doe"`.

Similarly, `t/friend` is a **find condition** that will return all contacts who have the `"friend"` tag, in this case `"Jane Doe"` and `"Alex Yeoh"` (and **not** `"Yervis Alexis"`, since [supported fields table](#find-fields-table) requires an exact tag match).

Since `n/do` and `t/friend` are both **find conditions**, they can constitute a **`FIND_EXPRESSION`**. The complete commands in each case would be:

- `find n/do`
- `find t/friend`

</box>

#### Find contacts: advanced filtering

While basic filtering is sufficient for most use cases, you may find that you need to perform more complex filtering. For example, you may want to find all contacts who have the tag `"friend"` *and* whose names contain the substring `"do"`. Or you may want to find all contacts whose addresses contain the substring `"street"` *or* whose names *do not* contain the substring `"ye"`.

You can accomplish this and more using our powerful advanced filtering syntax, which supports arbitrarily-complex **`FIND_EXPRESSIONs`**, which can be composed of many **find conditions** combined or transformed by **logical operators**.

<panel header="**Supported Logical Operators**" type="primary" id="find-logical-operators-table" expanded no-close>

The following logical operators are supported, and are listed in order of precedence (from highest to lowest):

| Operator | Description | Usage |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `(` and `)` | Parentheses for grouping | `(FIND_EXPRESSION)`
| `!`     | Logical NOT | `!FIND_EXPRESSION`
| `&&`    | Logical AND | `FIND_EXPRESSION && FIND_EXPRESSION`
| <code>&#124;&#124;</code> | Logical OR | <code>FIND_EXPRESSION &#124;&#124; FIND_EXPRESSION</code>

</panel>

<br>

Note that the smallest possible **find expressions** is simply a **find condition**.

**Find expressions** can be nested arbitrarily deeply, and that parentheses can be used to group  **find expressions** together to specify the order of evaluation.

<br>

<box>

For example, given the following contacts (some fields omitted for brevity):

| Name | Tags |
| ---- | ---- |
| John Doe | neighbor, colleague |
| Jane Doe | neighbor, friend |
| Alex Yeoh | friend |
| Yervis Alexis | girlfriend |

The following are valid **`FIND_EXPRESSIONs`**:

- `!n/do` will return all contacts whose names do **not** contain the substring `"do"`, in this case `"Alex Yeoh"` and `"Yervis Alexis"
- `n/do && t/friend` will return all contacts whose names contain the substring `"do"` **and** who have the `"friend"` tag, in this case `"Jane Doe"`.
- `n/do || t/friend` will return all contacts whose names contain the substring `"do"` **or** who have the `"friend"` tag, in this case `"John Doe"`, `"Jane Doe"`, and `"Alex Yeoh"`.
- `n/do && (t/friend || t/colleague)` will return all contacts whose names contain the substring `"do"` **and** who have either the `"friend"` or `"colleague"` tag, in this case `"John Doe"`, `"Jane Doe"`, and `"Alex Yeoh"`.

Note that the last example is **not equivalent** to `n/do && t/friend || t/colleague`. Due to the higher precedence of `&&` compared to `||`, this will return all contacts whose names contain the substring `"do"` **and** who have the `"friend"` tag, **or** who have the `"colleague"` tag, in this case `"Jane Doe"` and `"Alex Yeoh"`.

</box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CampusConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
