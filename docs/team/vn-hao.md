# Project: CampusConnect

**CampusConnect** is a desktop application built for **NUS students** living on campus to help them **stay organised**, **stay connected**, and **make the on-campus experience at NUS stress-free**. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
