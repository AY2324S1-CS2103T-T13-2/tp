* This is **CampusConnect**, a desktop application built for students living on campus to help users stay organised, stay connected, and make the on-campus experience at NUS stress-free! Example usages:
  * Keep track of various contact details of fellow campus residents
  * Receive reminders for fellow campus residents' birthdays
  * Mark specific contacts as emergency contacts
  * Search for fellow campus residents using expressive filters
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[CampusConnect Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-2.github.io/tp/)**.
